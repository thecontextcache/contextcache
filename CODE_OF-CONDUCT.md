# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the ContextCache community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being patient with newcomers and those learning the project
* Respecting privacy and confidentiality
* Acknowledging the work and contributions of others

* GitHub repositories (issues, pull requests, discussions, code reviews)
* Project communication channels (Discord, Slack, mailing lists, if established)
* Project events (online or in-person)

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers responsible for enforcement at **thecontextcache@gmail.com** (or via GitHub issue if no email is configured).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

When reporting, please include:

* Your contact information
* Names (real, usernames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
* Your account of what occurred, including any relevant links or screenshots
* Any additional context or information that may be helpful
